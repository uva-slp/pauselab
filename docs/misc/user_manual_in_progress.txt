PAUSELAB – BECVILLE: USER MANUAL
The PauseLab BeCville web application facilitates community betterment through placemaking and civic engagement. The application will follow the timeline of a community project from the collection of ideas to the finalization of the physical projects.
This user manual will outline the utilization of the PauseLab BeCville website with respect to the various types of users that will be present.

COMMON FUNCTIONALITIES
Account Creation
Site users, unless assigned by an admin, must create an account for access to features specific to certain roles. However, an account is not needed by the members of the community to submit ideas, view and vote on proposals or follow the blog.
To create an account, users must first click on the “login” button, upon which they will be redirected to the login page.

If the user has an account already, they may simply login using their email and password. New users, however, will click “Sign up”. To create an account, the users must fill out the new account form.

After the form is completed, the users will have an account with the role of Artist. They may sign out of the website at any time by pressing the “logout” button on the top left corner of the website.
Idea Submission
The idea submission feature is open to the general public with no PauseLab account needed. This idea submission feature, however, will only be available during the Idea Collection Phase of the project lifecycle.
There are two ways that users may submit ideas. The first is by clicking “submit an idea” on the homepage of the website.
