As of now our main code coverage is around 97.75%, with about 20 lines uncovered. Here are the main issues for those lines:

1. **destroy fallback** - For some of our controller destroy methods we have else statements when something isn't deleted correctly. This is an exceptional case that is difficult to replicate in RSpec (we would only expect it to happen if the DB connection fails suddenly).
2. **gen_csv**- We are still talking with customer about what he wants exported at end of iteration.  We have code that generates CSVs for all models, but as of now we only generate three of them.  If Matthew wants mass-emails, categories, etc. exported we will include them in the export zip function, and if not we will get rid of those lines of dead code. (Note: that we tested most of these calls anyway)
3. **file upload button initializer** - We have some custom code for file upload buttons, but this doesn't seem to get called when templates with the button are created. Our standard ways of testing cannot cover this; perhaps a feature test that simulates interaction with the button can do that, but this is more trouble than it's worth.
4. **user in devise** - Devise is a gem we've been using to make user registration easier. There is functionality in the gem that makes it quite difficult to allow RSpec to create user registrations like most other models. (Mock users can be created, but the controller actions to create users do not work.)
