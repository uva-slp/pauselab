deployment
==========

We met with Matt on 12/2 to discuss deployment options. He has been using wordpress
to deploy pauselab's website however since wordpress cannot be used for a rails
application, we recommended Heroku as a possible alternative.


## 01-28-17
We discussed alternative deployment options among Heroku, AWS and other CMS options.
Heroku as a platform was deemed to be slow and not the best fit for pauselab. We
established as a group that we would use **AWS** when deploying our rails app.s
