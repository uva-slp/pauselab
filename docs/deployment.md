# Deployment

## 12-02-16

We met with Matt to discuss deployment options. He has been using Wordpress to deploy Pauselab's website however since Wordpress cannot be used for a rails application, we recommended Heroku as a possible alternative.

We discussed alternative deployment options among Heroku, AWS and other CMS options. Heroku as a platform was deemed to be slow and not the best fit for Pauselab. We established as a group that we would use **AWS** when deploying our Rails app.

System was deployed successfully under Matt's AWS account, though he needs to do some configuration on his end. He will likely need to set up a domain name that's better than the long AWS one.
