In 2015, The PauseLab received a grant that provides funds for community members to
allocate towards arts projects and programs using a PB inspired process we are calling
Be-Cville. Starting in the fall of 2016, residents of Charlottesvilleâ€™s Strategic
Investment Area (SIA) will be asked to submit ideas for ways to improve their neighborhood(s)
and then, as a community,review those ideas. Next, local artists will be asked to
develop proposals based on the resident-submitted ideas. Once finalized, proposals
will then be presented to the neighborhood in the spring of 2017, and residents will
vote on which ideas they want to see become reality. After this initial year, our hope
is to continue Be-Cville on an annual basis, connecting the project with other community 
and civic development projects to make sure residents have a role deciding the future of their city.
